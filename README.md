Accuracy: 93.76%, The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. 
Confusion Matrix: True Positives (TP): 590 (actual FAKE, predicted FAKE) True Negatives (TN): 598 (actual REAL, predicted REAL) False Positives (FP): 38 (actual REAL, predicted FAKE) False Negatives (FN): 41 (actual FAKE, predicted REAL) 
This indicates that the model is performing well with a high accuracy and low misclassification rates.
